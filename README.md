# About Section

- Text Section describing myself
Hello, I am a website developer designing, building and launching websites to the internet. I started learning and having an interest in Information Technology my first year in high school. I started out learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I then learned Javascript and built an adventure game to add a little bit of fun in my coding journey. I live in Kenya, the silicon valley of Africa. I can help grow your business by building a digital footprint of it on the internet and help boost your business to the digital age

# Skill Section

- 3 column layout with 2 rows displaying our technical tools: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Git and Github
Thinking of putting logos of each tool
Each tool should have a small definition of what i can do with them

HTML5 - The face and body of a website
CSS - The colorful design of a website
Javascript - The interactive nature of a website
Bootstrap - The simplified version of Css
Git - Version control system
Github - Introducing your work to the world

# My Work Section

- 2 column 2 row section with containers of website images i have done each with a scale increasing animation

onHover this container images should have a link icon pop up to visit the actual website which will have a github pages repo
This hover container should have a linear gradient background where top is transparent and bottom is a mix of the primary red and secondary blue color

# Contact Section

- We need to get client First Name, Last Name, Email and Message
FIrst Name and Last Name share the same line when on big screens but split into their own block lines on small screens
Contact form should have a border with the primary color as border-color and so should the input borders
Contact container should be centered

# Footer Section

- Should be 2 columns first for the logo and moto then the contact details grid column inluding social media links in them placed in an inline style

Should contain contact details
Should have social media links
First Grid container should have the Logo and Moto of business


# New Section Design ideal

- For the work section we can have 2 column containers each a slideshow showing two of the works i have done using bootstrap carousel feature
Or Have  full viewport width and height slideshow showcasing the works i have done

# Considerations of skill section
Thinking of putting the skill text in the middle of the container and use sketched lines to show skill with small icon image and name surrounding the skill text

Also considering using animation where only see skill text moving inside a container from left to right and then repeat
